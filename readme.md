## minishop_laravel
This project is an example of a simple online store written in Laravel. The frontend uses its own micro scss framework. This store was developed for one friend as an experiment without technical specifications. Therefore, in many places the business logic may not be clear. Unfortunately, this store has not yet been released. The work is not finished.

_There may be many errors at startup, so I donâ€™t recommend wasting time on launching this project._
