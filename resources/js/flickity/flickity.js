// The open source license is designed for you to use Flickity 
// to build open source and personal projects. 
// The Flickity open source license is GPLv3. 
// The GPLv3 has many terms, but the most important is how it is sticky when you distribute your work publicly. 
// From the GPL FAQ:

// If you release the modified version to the public in some way, 
// the GPL requires you to make the modified source code available 
// to the program's users, under the GPL.

// Releasing your project that uses Flickity under the GPLv3, 
// in turn, requires your project to be licensed under the GPLv3. 
// If you are okay with this, feel free to use Flickity under the GPLv3,
// without purchasing a commercial license.
